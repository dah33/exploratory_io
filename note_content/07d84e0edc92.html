<h1 class="">My August Flight Delay Report</h1><p class="">I have analyzed the airline delay data based on the latest <b>August</b> data from the feaderal transportantion office. &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p class="">How late the worst 100 flights for each Carrier?</p></li><li><p class="">Which days of the week are there most of the flights are?</p></li><li>Correlation between Departure Delay and Arrival Delay times</li></ul><h2 class="">Worst 100 Flights for each Carrier</h2><p class="">We can see that most of the worst 100 flights from the airline carriers like American, Delta, Southwest, etc. are between 500 minutes and 1500 minutes range. On the other hand, the carriers like Alaska (AS), Virgin (VX), etc. are showing their worst flights being less than 500 minutes range.&nbsp;</p><tam-chart src="airline_delay_2016-08_13" tabindex="0" dataframe="airline_delay_2016-08" label="Boxplot" deleted="false" data-closable="true" style="display: block; max-width: 90%; width: 700px; height: 400px; outline: none; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto;"></tam-chart><p class=""><span style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.02em; white-space: initial;">Which days of the week are there most of the flights are?</span><br></p><p class="">We can see that most of the states have more flights between Monday and Wednesday.

I have used K-means algorithms to cluster the delay data. The cluster 5 that is close to zero for both Arrival and Departure Delay times have less correlation between the two.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p class=""><br></p>
