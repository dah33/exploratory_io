<h1 class="">My August Flight Delay Report</h1><p class="">I have analyzed the airline delay data based on the latest data from the feaderal transportantion office. Overall, it is showing the trend from the last report with a few exceptions.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p class="">Worst 100 Flights per Carrier based on Departure Delay Time</p></li><li>Correlation Analysis</li></ul><h2 class="">Worst 100 Flights per Carrier</h2><p class="">I have found that flights tend to delay at Friday and Sunday nights. This might reflect the fact that many business people travel around these times.&nbsp;</p><tam-chart src="correlation_viz_1" tabindex="0" dataframe="correlation" label="Chart 1" deleted="false" data-closable="true" style="display: block; max-width: 90%; width: 700px; height: 400px; outline: none; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto;"></tam-chart><p class="focused"><br></p><p class=""><br></p><h2 class="">Are Arrival Delay and Departure Delay times correlated?</h2><p class=""><span style="letter-spacing: -0.003em; line-height: 1.7em; white-space: initial;">The longer the delay times are the more correlation we can see. I have used K-means algorithms to cluster the delay data. The cluster 5 that is close to zero for both Arrival and Departure Delay times have less correlation between the two.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p class=""><br></p>
